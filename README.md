## Head

### Meta tag


* [ ] **Title:** A title is used on all pages (SEO: Google calculates the pixel width of the characters used in the title, and it cuts off between 472 and 482 pixels. The average character limit would be around 55-characters).

```html
<title>Page Title less than 55 characters</title>
```

> * ðŸ›  [SERP Snippet Generator](https://www.sistrix.com/serp-snippet-generator/)

* [ ] **Description:** A meta description is provided, it is unique and doesn't possess more than 150 characters.

```html
<!-- Meta Description -->
<meta name="description" content="Description of the page less than 150 characters">
```

> * ðŸ“– [Meta Description - HTML - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML#Adding_an_author_and_description)

* [ ] **Favicons:** Each favicon has been created and displays correctly. If you have only a `favicon.ico`, put it at the root of your site. Normally you won't need to use any markup. However, it's still good practice to link to it using the example below. Today, **PNG format is recommended** over `.ico` format (dimensions: 32x32px).

```html
<!-- Standard favicon -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="https://example.com/favicon.ico">
<!-- Recommended favicon format -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://example.com/favicon.png">
```

### HTML tags

* [ ] **Language attribute:** The `lang` attribute of your website is specified and related to the language of the current page.

```html
<html lang="en">
```

* [ ] **Direction attribute:** The direction of lecture is specified on the html tag (It can be used on another HTML tag).

```html
<html dir="rtl">
```

> * ðŸ“– [dir - HTML - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir)

* [ ] **Alternate language:** The language tag of your website is specified and related to the language of the current page.

```

### Social meta

Visualize and generate automatically our social meta tags with [Meta Tags](https://metatags.io/)

***Facebook OG*** and ***Twitter Cards*** are, for any website, highly recommended. The other social media tags can be considered if you target a particular presence on those and want to ensure the display.

* [ ] **Facebook Open Graph:** All Facebook Open Graph (OG) are tested and no one is missing or with false information. Images need to be at least 600 x 315 pixels, although 1200 x 630 pixels is recommended.

> **Notes:** Using `og:image:width` and `og:image:height` will specify the image dimensions to the crawler so that it can render the image immediately without having to asynchronously download and process it.

```html
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/page.html">
<meta property="og:title" content="Content Title">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/image.jpg">
<meta property="og:description" content="Description Here">
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Site Name">
<meta property="og:locale" content="en_US">
<!-- Next tags are optional but recommended -->
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200">
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630">
```

## JavaScript

### Best practices

* [ ] **JavaScript Inline:** You don't have any JavaScript code inline (mixed with your HTML code).
* [ ] **Concatenation:** JavaScript files are concatenated.
* [ ] **Minification:** JavaScript files are minified (you can add the `.min` suffix).

> * ðŸ“– [Minify Resources (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/MinifyResources)

* [ ] **Optimized and updated JS libraries:** All JavaScript libraries used in your project are necessary (prefer Vanilla Javascript for simple functionalities), updated to their latest version and don't overwhelm your JavaScript with unnecessary methods.
